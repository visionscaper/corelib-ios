Very basic library to create iOS apps.
In development.

To clone the repo and its submodule(s) to a new directory vi-corelib-ios:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/visionscaper/corelib-ios.git vi-corelib-ios
    
This library uses [aharren/LibComponentLogging-Core](https://github.com/aharren/LibComponentLogging-Core).
